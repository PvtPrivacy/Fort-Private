- Even if you have only one IP adress at your disposal you can still host many domain names on a single IP address using Apache.
- You can install Apache by using the command `$ sudo apt-get -y install apache2`
- Virtual Hosting means hosting multiple domain names on a computer (or server in other words.)
- Name-based virtual hosting is usually simpler than IP-based virutal hosts.
- Certain servers want to be accessible by more than one name. ServerAlias directive helps that. 



 # Installing Apache and testing localhost

I first began installing apach2 by typing a following command.
`$ sudo apt-get -y install apache2` 

Obviously you should also run the command `$ sudo apt-get update` to make sure everything is up to date.

As you can see the terminal responded to it by intaiting the installation of apache2

I then opened web browser inside of the virtual computer and typed in the localhost address which then appeared this.

This means that apache2 has succesfully installed and is working correctly. 

# Checking the logs 

For this part, I must look for the logs, that appear when I load a page from my server. The most common way of checking the logs is by going to the /var/log/ location. 
In there we must find apache2, if you don't have it then that likely means that you haven't installed it or it was installed inproprerly. 

`sudo ls /var/log/apache2/`

`sudo tail -5 /var/log/apache2/access.log`

In the access log contains quite a lot of infomation. This infomation can inculde for example, the date of the log when it was created, what web broswer was used for th

# Creating new name based virtual host 

So I began creating a new name based virtual host config by inserting the command into the terminal

`$ sudoedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/pyora.example.com.conf`

Where I had to fill with crucial infomation or in other words fill a "template" for the new host

Then, I had to create folders in a correct location that I had filled in the config. You can do two ways, either by terminal or by using the Linux interface, but we going to do this via terminal.

`$ mkdir -p /home/dansku/publicsites/fortprivacy.example.com/`

This command essentially creates a simple HTML file that contains the word "fortprivacy"
`$ echo fortprivacy > /home/xubuntu/publicsites/fortprivacy.example.com/index.html`


I disabled a config file by doing this command, so it wouldn't interfare with the new config I made for.
`sudo a2dissiste 00-default.conf`


Then I inserted these commands that to test if I get the correct output from the terminal, which I succesfully did.

`$ curl -H 'Host: fortprivacy.example.com' localhost`
`$ curl localhost`

Then I tested if my web page is working by going to the localhost via web browser.
http://localhost

It worked!

Now I must added more contents to it as well as make it valid HTML page.

`cd $ cd /home/dansku/publicsite/fortprivacy.example.com`

`micro index.html`

    e) Tee validi HTML5 sivu.
    f) Anna esimerkit 'curl -I' ja 'curl' -komennoista. Selitä 'curl -I' muutamasta näyttämästä otsakkeesta (response header), mitä ne tarkoittavat.
    m) Vapaaehtoinen, suosittelen tekemään: Hanki GitHub Education -paketti.
    n) Vapaaehtoinen, vaikea: Tee Apachelle nimipohjainen virtuaalipalvelu (name based virtual host). Voit simuloida nimipalvelun toimintaa hosts-tiedoston avulla.
    o) Vapaaehtoinen, vaikea: Laita sama tietokone vastaamaan kahdellla eri sivulla kahdesta eri nimestä. Eli kaksi weppisiteä samalla koneelle, esim. foo.example.com ja bar.example.com.
