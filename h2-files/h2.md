- The command lines that are used in Linux been used before internet even existed.
- the dollar sign is the command prompt that doesn't need to be manually typed. It automatically is written in the command prompt.
- The command PWD prints the full path of your directory
- Pico and Nano are text editors that are used in Linux. The difference between them is that Pico provides more additional futures and also has different license.


# Linux Commands 
So the main goal was to test several commands and install a few softwares to the Linux such as microeditor. I first run a command that would update the list of available packages. In order to ensure that the system is up-to-date with the latest package releases, so there wouldn't be any issues running the system or installing softwares.

`$ sudo apt-get update`

The word sudo means that I am currently in "adminstartor mode" with the highest priviileges you can be.
It is extremely important that you type correctly all the letters and the commands, otherwise the system will not recognize it

I began searching a micro editor that would have to install to this system. I entered the command that would search the software with keywords I entered. Admin priviilieges is not required at this case so I didn't have to put "sudo" at the begniing of my command

![Virtual Machine Command #2](https://github.com/PvtPrivacy/Fort-Private/assets/156780345/765a4245-0b87-4b68-a827-df747d36fac5)


`$ apt-cahce search micro editor `
The terminal gave me quite a lot of options to choose from, but I choose the one that I had to install which was the micro editor.
I then wrote the following command in order for the system to install it. Now it is extermely imporant to always make sure you wrote everything correctly as I have previously mentioned!
`$ sudo apt-get -y install micro`
Micro was then installed and ready to be used. Usually you have to check via terminal if it's there or not but I checked by clicking the applications tab and checking if it's there or not.

# B) 

For this part, I had to check the infomation about my hardware configuration, to do this I had to install another application for it. 
`$ sudo apt-get -y install lshw`
Which I then typed the following command. 
`sudo lshw -short -sanitize`
The command then printed in the terminal the hardware of the system. As you can see, since the system is running on virtual box it does notify you in the list that virtual box is being used or at least gives you an indication of it.

# Three applications )


Fortune

Cowsay: 

Pacman4console: 

You could install one by one by typing the command at the time, but I wanted to install all of them with one command, so I typed the following command
`sudo apt-get -y pacman4console fortune cowsay`
Since these apps are separated by a space it recognizes them as separate entities. 
You don*t have to put -y, if you want to manually accept the request

# Directories
The following imporant directories are
/home
/home/user/
/etc/
/media/
/var/log/

In order to access them, you must type certain commands in order to access them and see what files are contained within if it has.

So in order to go to home directory it happens like this
`$ cd /home`
By typing the `ls` command it will list the files in it, beacause only user is currently using the computer it will show only my username.
`$ cd /home/dansku`
Same thing as previous but lists files from user "dansku" directory.  

`$ cd /etc`
etc directory is where all system wide settings can be found. 
`$ cd /media`



# The Pipe |
Sometimes the files listed in the directory can be overwhelming. There is a way to eaze that, that allows you to read one screenfull at a time.

If you press AltGR + "<>|" that is next to left shift you will type a pipe looking symbol, which can be used to fulfill this command. The pipe gives the ability to combine two commands 

`$ ls /etc|less`

This command will able you to read in the directory. Example in below.

# Linux Logs

Logs are way to track users or the system activities. For example. if someone is trying to access your computer but fails to enter the correct password the log.

`sudo journalctl --follow`
"Follow" is a option in the journalctl that is used to contiunously display new logs entries that are added to the journal

As you can see the journal registered 3 incorrect password attempt. My user attempted to use sudo and provided an incorrect password three times. This could be a security concern as it suggests that someone is to gain unaothirzed access.

USER=root: Indicates that the sudo command was executed with elevated privileges, and the user who executed it is "root."
COMMAND=/usr/bin/apt-get-update: This specifies the actual command that was executed using sudo.




The 

D-virtualbox: This part could be the hostname or machine identifier. It's indicating the origin or hostname of the system where the event occurred.

sudo[3624]: Indicates that the sudo command was used. The number in square brackets (3624 in this case) is likely the process ID (PID) of the sudo command.

Userman : 3 incorrect password attempts: Indicates that the user "Userman" attempted to use sudo and provided an incorrect password three times. This could be a security concern as it suggests someone is trying to gain unauthorized access.

TTY=pts/2: Specifies the terminal (TTY) where the sudo command was executed. In this case, it was on pseudo-terminal 2 (pts/2). TTY information helps to identify where the command was executed.

PWD=/home/Userman: Represents the present working directory when the sudo command was executed. In this case, it was the home directory of the user "Userman."

USER=root: Indicates that the sudo command was executed with elevated privileges, and the user who executed it is "root."

COMMAND=/usr/bin/apt-get-update: Specifies the actual command that was executed using sudo. In this case, it was an attempt to run the command /usr/bin/apt-get-update

File Manipulation

Easiest text editors are pico and nano.




The command line used in Linux and BSD has survived the test of time. It existed before Google, Web, Linux, Windows and even before the Internet. It's also convenient, fast, expressive and easy to automate. I use it every day.
