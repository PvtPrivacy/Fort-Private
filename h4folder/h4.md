# Server
In this assignment I was tasked with renting my own private server, because I prefer to avoid using any method payments when it comes to courses, I will try to use the free package that we get from the school. Unfortunately, GitHub was asking for student credentials (despite me using the school email to register another account for the purpose of getting the benefits) I strictly prefer to avoid handing out credentials unless it's absolutely necessary for me.

Though there is an altrenative that I believe is free and pretty much supported in Linux . Using Steamworks SDK. Steamworks SDK is developed by Valve that help you configure, manage, and operate your game on Steam, but it can be used for other purposes, such as configuring a server or setting up a local content server.
