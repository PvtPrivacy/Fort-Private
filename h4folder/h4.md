# A/B/C/D Renting own private server & domain
In this assignment I was tasked with renting my own private server, because I prefer to avoid using any method payments when it comes to courses, I will try to use the free package that we get from the school. Unfortunately, GitHub was asking for student credentials (despite me using the school email to register another account for the purpose of getting the benefits) I strictly prefer to avoid handing out credentials unless it's absolutely necessary for me.
