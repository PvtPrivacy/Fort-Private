## Creating a custom command


First we must create a text file, I usually use nano but any text editor can be used for this.

`nano saysomething` 

Now the file title must be named after the command name you want for your custom command, otherwise it won't work accordingly.

If I type in the terminal `say something without` it will print the following output..

And voila! I managed to code a really simple command that anyone can use without need of sudo command/admin privileges
