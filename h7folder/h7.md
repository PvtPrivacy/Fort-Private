## Creating a custom command

As per instructions. I started completely from scratch, meaning a complete new virtual machine. I followed the course's instructions as well as my instructions that I made for the h1 assignment. The process of creating a new virtual machine from scratch was alo ot more efficient than previously.

First we must create a text file, I usually use nano but any text editor can be used for this.

`nano saysomething` 

Now the file title must be named after the command name you want for your custom command, otherwise it won't work accordingly. 

I want my custom command to greet me and tell me what time it is.

Now in order for the command to function I must grant the permission for this file to be executed when necessary. The folder must also be located in a correct location for it function as well.

`sudo mv saysomething /usr/local/bin/`

After this everything should work now.
If I type in the terminal `say something without` it will print the following output..

And voila! I managed to code a really simple command that anyone can use without need of sudo command/admin privileges
